# Scala Exercises

## Day 1

- [Exercise 1](First_Session/ex_ONE/src/Main.scala) : Write a Scala program that takes two numbers as input and prints the larger number.
- [Exercise 2](First_Session/ex_TWO/src/Main.scala) : Write a Scala program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero. Print the appropriate message based on the input.
- [Exercise 3](First_Session/ex_THREE/src/Main.scala) : Write a Scala program that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not. Print "Leap year" or "Not a leap year" accordingly.
- [Exercise 4](First_Session/ex_FOUR/src/Main.scala) : Write a Scala program that prompts the user to enter their age. If the age is less than 18, print "You are a minor." Otherwise, print "You are an adult.
- [Exercise 5](First_Session/ex_FIVE/src/Main.scala) : Write a Scala program that asks the user to enter a character. Determine if the character is a vowel or a consonant. Print the result accordingly.
- [Exercise 6](First_Session/ex_SIX/src/Main.scala) : Write a Scala program that prompts the user to enter a number. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz". If it is only divisible by 3, print "Fizz". If it is only divisible by 5, print "Buzz". Otherwise, print the number itself.
- [Exercise 7](First_Session/ex_SEVEN/src/Main.scala) : Write a Scala program that prompts the user to enter three numbers. Determine and print the largest number using conditional expressions.
- [Exercise 8](First_Session/ex_EIGHT/src/Main.scala) : Write a Scala program that asks the user to enter a character. Determine if the character is an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, or a digit. Print the result accordingly.
- [Exercise 9](First_Session/ex_NINE/src/Main.scala) : Write a Scala program that prompts the user to enter their grade (A, B, C, D, or F). Based on the grade, print a corresponding message such as "Excellent!", "Good job!", "Keep it up!", "You need to improve", or "Failed".
- [Exercise 10](First_Session/ex_TEN/src/Main.scala) : Write a Scala program that prompts the user to enter a month number (1-12). Print the corresponding month name, such as "January", "February", etc., using conditional expressions.
- [Exercise 11](First_Session/ex_ELEVEN/src/Main.scala) : Write a Scala program that asks the user to enter a positive integer. Determine if the number is prime or not. Print the result accordingly.
- [Exercise 12](First_Session/ex_TWELVE/src/Main.scala) : Write a Scala program that prompts the user to enter a three-digit number. Determine if the number is an Armstrong number or not. Print the result accordingly.


## Day 2
  ### Collections and Arrays
- [Exercise 1](Second_Session/ex_ONE/ExOne.scala) : Implement a function that takes a list of strings and returns the most frequently occurring word in the list. If there are multiple words with the same frequency, return the one that appears first.
- [Exercise 2](Second_Session/ex_TWO/ExTwo.scala) : Create a function that takes a list of integers and returns the top k numbers with the highest frequency. If there are ties, return the numbers in ascending order.
- [Exercise 3](Second_Session/ex_THREE/ExThree.scala) : Implement a function that takes a map of student names and their corresponding scores and returns the top k students with the highest scores.
- [Exercise 4](Second_Session/ex_FOUR/ExFour.scala) : Create a function that takes an array of integers and returns the longest subarray with consecutive elements. For example, in the array [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9], the longest consecutive subarray is [5, 6, 7].
- [Exercise 5](Second_Session/ex_FIVE/ExFive.scala) : Implement a function that takes a list of strings and sorts them based on their lengths in descending order. If two strings have the same length, sort them lexicographically. the larger number. 
### Strings
- [Exercise 6](Second_Session/ex_SIX/ExSix.scala) : Create a function that takes a string and returns the longest substring without repeating characters.
- [Exercise 7](Second_Session/ex_SEVEN/ExSeven.scala) : Implement a function that takes a string and returns the count of distinct words in the string. Ignore punctuation and consider words separated by spaces.
- [Exercise 8](Second_Session/ex_EIGHT/ExEight.scala) : Create a function that takes a string and returns the most frequent character in the string. If there are multiple characters with the same frequency, return the one that appears first in the string.
- [Exercise 9](Second_Session/ex_NINE/ExNine.scala) : Implement a function that takes two strings and checks if they are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.
- [Exercise 10](Second_Session/ex_TEN/ExTen.scala) : Create a function that takes a string and returns the shortest substring that contains all the characters of a given set. The substring should have the minimum length.
